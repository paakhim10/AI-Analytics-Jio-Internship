# AI-Analytics-Jio-Internship
All Jupyter Notebooks and code files associated with my internship at Jio Platforms in the AI/Analytics Department. 
Contains exploratory data analysis of customer databases and sample databases.


##### Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA of databases includes data cleaning, formatting, normalization, binning, and further determining correlations between different data fields of a set.
Data visualization is also done for easier client comprehension using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

##### Machine Learning 
Built a classification model with 90%+ accuracy to assign over 1000 support ticket mails to different categories saving manual computation and analysis time using Scikit Learn libraries. The dataset and the model are not included in the repository as they contain sensitive company information.

##### Datasets
The datasets analyzed contain sample customer information, real-time transaction details, and payment specifics pertaining to different times and places. Correlation between different fields in these datasets revealed trends and patterns that further helped in predicting NaN and future values.
